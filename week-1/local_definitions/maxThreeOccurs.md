This example from the lecture show how one can break down a complex function into smaller parts. It often helps to structure the code using local definitions, e.g. in a `where` block.

Things you can try:

1. Make all helper definitions local to `maxThreeOccurs`.
2. Turn the `where` blocks into ` let ... in ...` expressions.
