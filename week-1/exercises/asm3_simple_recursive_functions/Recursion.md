Try to implement these three functions using recursion!

(a) `mult :: (Int, Int) -> Int` which multiplies its two arguments. Use only recursion and addition/subtraction.

(b) `log2 :: Int -> Int` which computes the integer part of the base 2 logarithm of its arguments.

(c) `isPrime :: Int -> Bool` which tests whether a given integer is prime.

You may assume that the functions will only be called with non-negative arguments (`log2` with positive arguments).
